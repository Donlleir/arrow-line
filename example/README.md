# arrow-line example application

This is just a small page for exploring `arrow-line`. It's built with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [materialize.css](https://materializecss.com/)

1. install with `npm install`
2. build with `npm run build`
3. run webserver with `npm start` - it should start on `localhost:8080`

_(it's the same with `yarn`)_

Edit `src/index.js` and `index.html` to play with various options. Repeat 2-3 to see the changes.
